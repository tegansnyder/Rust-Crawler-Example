This example is very minimal. In an attempt to teach myself how to write a small Rust language program. I've pieced this very basic crawl operation against my domain to extract the links via DOM selectors.

It uses a few dependencies. To run it make sure you have Rust installed then run:
```sh
cargo run
```
